Droop AppIn the US, we are lucky to have easy access to some of the safest treated water in the world. We wake up in the morning, take a shower, brush our teeth, grab a cup of coffee, and head out for the day. Water is an important part of our daily lives and we use it for a wide variety of purposes, but do we really understand how much we use?Droop is an app that will help the users (specifically tenants) become aware of their water and energy consumption, and present them with opportunities to save water. Droop will work together with managing companies in New York City to help implement the use of this app in buildings. In return, managing companies will save thousands of dollars and also help the environment. Droop will monitor how many much domestic water the tenants use & waste while washing hands, showering, taking a bath, brushing teeth, flushing toilet, laundry, washing dishes by hand/dishwasher. Droop will help tenants incorporate water conserving methods and incentivize them for their improved behavior.
